# career-day-scheduler
Application for Taylor for creating schedules for mock interviews and career days

The goal of this application is to allow Taylor to create cohorts, and enter in students for those cohorts. Then, she can create an event
for a chohort, and add recruiters to that event (recruiters will be stored so that they can be added to any event, and Taylor only has to
input them once). Then, she generates a schedule for that event. At first, it will be randomized, but eventually I'd like to use some sort
of algorithm - right now I'm thinking of doing a greedy search, maybe with a random component so that she can re-generate the schedule to
get a different one.
